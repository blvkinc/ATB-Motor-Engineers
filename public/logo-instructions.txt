Logo Instructions:

1. Create or download a logo image and save it as "logo.png"
2. Place the logo.png file in this public directory
3. The logo should ideally be:
   - Square shaped (recommended dimensions: 512x512 pixels)
   - Have a transparent background
   - Include automotive imagery that represents ATB Motor Engineers
   - Use colors that match the blue/purple theme of the website

Once added to the public directory, the logo will automatically be used throughout the website.

Note: Until you add a custom logo, you may see missing image icons where the logo should appear.
